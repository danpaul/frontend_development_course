## React

- Leucippus and Democritus

Atomist analogy

Atoms = Components
Void = DOM / Virtual DOM
Collisions & Combinations = Component Composition
Emergent Qualities = Rendered UI

---

Atomism → The universe is made of indivisible atoms.
React → Applications are made of components, the smallest reusable units of UI.

Atomism → Atoms differ in shape, size, position, and arrangement, producing everything we experience.
React → Components differ by props, state, and composition, producing different UIs.

Atomism → Same atoms can form infinitely different things depending on arrangement.
React → Same components can be reused and arranged in infinitely different ways to build unique UIs.
