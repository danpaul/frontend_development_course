# Frontend Development Class Materials

## About

This repository contains materials for the Frontend Development course.

## Usage

- Clone this repo
- Everything you need to get started is in the `/presentations` directory
  - Presentations are organized per-class-week by prefix. The prefix for class one is "01", week 2 is "02", etc.
  - These presentations are are HTML files. You need to serve them. A simple way to do this is by installing the "Live Server" VS Code extension then simply right-click on the presentation HTML file and select "Open with Live Server". Any other simple way of serving a directory locally will work for this as well.
  - Presentations may contain references to other materials, for instance demos. These are all in this repo.

## Studying

- Read class presentations _before class_. So, before the second week of class, you should have read all presentations starting with "02".
- There are some additional materials referenced in the presentation that you should review. If you see "Read" or "Watch" in a presentation, read or watch that material before class.
