# Frontend Development Course Materials

## About

<<<<<<< HEAD
This repository contains materials for the Frontend Development class.

Please clone this repo. You may want to refrain from making changes, at least directly on the main branch, as materials may get updated throughout the term, requiring you to pull (and potentially creating merge conflicts if you have changes on the main branch).

## Usage

The `/presentations` directory contains weekly presentations. The presentations use a two digit prefix to indicate week (i.e. "01" for week 1). A simple way to do this is by add the Live Server extension to VS Code and then right-clicking on the file and selecting "Open with live server".

You must serve the contents of the `/presentations` directory to view the presentations.

- `/presentations` - contains the weekly class presentations.
- `/demos` - contains code demos referenced in the presentations.
- `/src` - contains scripts to generate the learning materials for this course. You can can ignore it or check it out if you are curious.

## Contributing

If you are interested in suggesting changes, you can look at the `./src/README.md` file. It contains information on the tools used to create these presentations.

If you make changes, please regenerate the presentations and issue a pull request.
=======
This repository contains general course information for the Frontend Development course and materials for weeks 1-4 (the web portion) of the course.

## Study guide with essential course details

See the [study guide](./STUDY_GUIDE.md). Read this if you are taking this course!

## Usage

To use, simply clone this repo and view the presentations in the `/presentations` directory. Each presentation is prefixed by week, i.e. "01" for week 1, "02" for week 2, etc.

The presentations are in HTML format so, you will need to serve them. A simple way to do this is by installing the "Live Server" VS Code extension then simply right-click on the presentation HTML file and selecting "Open with Live Server".

Presentations contain references to other materials to read/watch as well as demos. This is also mentioned in the study guide but, _after week 1, you should stay one week ahead with reading the presentations_. So, before week 2, you should have read both the week 1 and 2 presentations and completed reading/watching activities.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute by making additions, improvements or corrections to the presentations, look in the `/src` directory and start by reading `/src/README.md`. The markdown source for all the generated presentations are there.

You can submit a pull request with your updates.
