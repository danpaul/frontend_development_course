# Frontend Development Course Materials

## About

This repository contains materials for weeks 1-4 (the web portion) the Frontend Development course.

## Usage

To use, simply clone this repo and view the presentations in the `/presentations` directory. Each presentation is prefixed by week, i.e. "01" for week 1, "02" for week 2.

The presentations are in HTML format so, you will need to serve them. A simple way to do this is by installing the "Live Server" VS Code extension then simply right-click on the presentation HTML file and select "Open with Live Server".

Presentations contain references to other materials to read/watch as well as demos. This is also mentioned in the study guid but, _after week 1, you should stay one week ahead reading the presentations_. So, before week 2, you should have read both the week 1 and 2 presentations and completed reading/watching activities.
