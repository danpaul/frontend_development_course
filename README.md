# Frontend Development Course Materials

## About

This repository contains general course information for the Frontend Development course and materials for weeks 1-4 (the web portion) of the course.

## Study guide with essential course details

See the [study guide](./STUDY_GUIDE.md). Read this if you are taking this course!

## Usage

To use, simply clone this repo and view the presentations in the `/presentations` directory. Each presentation is prefixed by week, i.e. "01" for week 1, "02" for week 2, etc.

The presentations are in HTML format so, you will need to serve them. A simple way to do this is by installing the "Live Server" VS Code extension then simply right-click on the presentation HTML file and selecting "Open with Live Server".

Presentations contain references to other materials to read/watch as well as demos. This is also mentioned in the study guide but, _after week 1, you should stay one week ahead with reading the presentations_. So, before week 2, you should have read both the week 1 and 2 presentations and completed reading/watching activities.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute by making additions, improvements or corrections to the presentations, look in the `/src` directory and start by reading `/src/README.md`. The markdown source for all the generated presentations are there.

You can submit a pull request with your updates.
