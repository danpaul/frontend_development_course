# ADD Materials

## About

This repository contains materials for the Frontend Development class.

Please clone this repo. You may want to refrain from making changes, at least directly on the main branch, as materials may get updated throughout the term, requiring you to pull (and potentially creating merge conflicts if you have changes on the main branch).

## Usage

The `/presentations` directory contains weekly presentations. The presentations use a two digit prefix to indicate week (i.e. "01" for week 1). A simple way to do this is by add the Live Server extension to VS Code and then right-clicking on the file and selecting "Open with live server".

You must serve the contents of the `/presentations` directory to view the presentations.

- `/presentations` - contains the weekly class presentations.
- `/demos` - contains code demos referenced in the presentations.
- `/src` - contains scripts to generate the learning materials for this course. You can can ignore it or check it out if you are curious.

## Contributing

If you are interested in suggesting changes, you can look at the `./src/README.md` file. It contains information on the tools used to create these presentations.

If you make changes, please regenerate the presentations and issue a pull request.
