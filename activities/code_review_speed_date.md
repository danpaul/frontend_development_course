# Code Review Speed Date Activity

## Individually

Identify three items in your code that you would like to share. What you choose is entirely up to you. It can be a new library, a difficult problem solved, code you are happy with, code you are _not_ happy with.

## As a group

You will have a code review speed date. You will have three minutes to share the three items from your code. Afterwards, you will move on to a new speed date partner.
