# Frontend Development Study Guide

## Study Load

Credits: 5EC

## Course Structure

This course is divided into two main parts. The first (weeks 1-4) are focused on React, Typescript and associated tools for the web. The second extends these foundational tools to develop a React Native Application. The following subsections provide a few more details about each portion of the course.

### Web Development (weeks 1-4)

During this portion of the course, we will have weekly theory lectures combined with in-class activities. Each class is based around a series of presentations. The presentations contain additional readings and activities. The reading and watching activities should be completed before the upcoming class.

#### Hackathon

During this portion, we will also be working individually on a small hackathon project. The project will be demoed during week 4 in a competitive presentation (a winner will be decided). The only rule is that you use the stack we are learning about in weeks 1-4, namely Next.js with Typescript. This project is not assessed but is highly beneficial practice for the final React Native project

### React Native (weeks 5 - 7)

During weeks 5 - 7, you will receive lectures and work on a final React Native project. You will be assessed on the React Native project after week 7.

## Assessments

There are two assessments for this course:

1. Theory Exam (50% of final grade) - after week 7, you will have a written theory exam covering the theory topics from week 1-4. Theory topics will be drawn from lectures and reading/watching activities referenced in those lectures.
2. React Native Project (50% of final grade) - after week 7, you will be assessed on your React Native project.

### Passing

Both assessments must receive a passing mark of 55 to pass the course.
